I am a Samuel Eilenberg Assistant Professor at the Institute of Informatics, [Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics, and Mechanics](https://www.mimuw.edu.pl/en/), [University of Warsaw](https://en.uw.edu.pl/), where I have been since February 2025.  

My research focuses on algebraic complexity theory, which deals with the complexity of algebraic objects, such as polynomials. Additionally, I am also interested in computational complexity in general. Recently, I have also started pursuing several research directions in automata theory, with a particular interest in the computational aspects of formal power series and their rationality.  

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems (MPI-SWS)](https://www.mpi-sws.org/), working with [Joël Ouaknine](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~joel/), and at [Facets of Complexity](http://www.facetsofcomplexity.de/) and the [Institut für Mathematik, TU Berlin](https://www.math.tu-berlin.de/), collaborating with [Prof. Dr. Peter Bürgisser](https://www.math.tu-berlin.de/fachgebiete_ag_diskalg/fachgebiet_algorithmische_algebra/v_menue/members/prof_dr_peter_buergisser/).  

I was also a visiting doctoral candidate at the [Department of Computer Science, Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/department-of-computer-science), under the supervision of [Prof. Parinya Chalermsook](https://sites.google.com/site/parinyachalermsook/home).  

I earned my PhD in 2019 from [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/start.html), where I had the fortune to be advised by [Prof. Markus Bläser](https://www-cc.cs.uni-saarland.de/mblaeser/) and was affiliated with the [Max Planck Institute for Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/algorithms-complexity/). I also completed my Master’s studies at Saarland University.  

My academic journey began with a Bachelor’s degree from the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Delhi](http://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/).  

A brief [CV](/cv/) can be found here.
