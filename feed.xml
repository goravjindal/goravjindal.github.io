These concepts are crucial for understanding how homogeneous polynomials can be expressed as sums of powers of linear forms. \subsection{Waring Rank} The \textbf{Waring rank} of a homogeneous polynomial $f$ of degree $d$, denoted $\WR(f)$, is the smallest integer $r$ such that $f$ can be expressed as a sum of $d$-th powers of $r$ linear forms. Here, we work with $n+1$ variables $x_0, x_1, \dots, x_n$ over $\mathbb{C}$, and consider homogeneous polynomials of degree $d$ in these variables. The \textbf{Waring rank} of a homogeneous polynomial $f \in \mathbb{C}[x_0, x_1, \dots, x_n]$ of degree $d$, denoted $\WR(f)$, is the smallest integer $r$ such that $f$ can be written as a sum of $d$-th powers of $r$ linear forms: \[ \WR(f) = \min \left\{ r \in \bbN \mid f = \sum_{i=1}^{r} \ell_i(x_0, x_1, \dots, x_n)^d,\ \ell_i \text{ linear forms} \right\} \] \subsection{Border Waring Rank} The \textbf{border Waring rank} of a homogeneous polynomial $f$, denoted $\BWR(f)$, is a generalization that accounts for limits of polynomials with low rank. It is defined as the smallest integer $r$ such that $f$ lies in the closure of the set of polynomials with Waring rank at most $r$. This means $f$ can be expressed as a limit of a sequence of polynomials, each having Waring rank at most $r$: \[ f = \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} \sum_{i=1}^{r} \ell_i(\varepsilon)^d \] where $\ell_i(\varepsilon)$ are linear forms whose coefficients depend rationally on $\varepsilon$. Another equivalent definition of the border Waring rank involves the expansion of $f$ as the coefficient of the lowest degree term of $\varepsilon$ as follows: \[ f = \text{Coeff}_{\varepsilon^k} \left( \sum_{i=1}^r \ell_i^d \right) \] Here $\ell_i$ are linear forms in $\bbC[\varepsilon][\lstp{x}{n}[0]]$ and $k$ is the minimal power of $\varepsilon$ in the right hand side of above equation. For example, for $f = x^{d-1}y$, we have \[ dx^{d-1}y = \text{Coeff}_{\varepsilon} \paren{ (x+\varepsilon y)^d - x^d } \] which shows that $\BWR(x^{d-1}y) = 2$, even though $\WR(x^{d-1}y) = d$. \section{Waring Rank of Monomials} For monomials, the study of their Waring has yielded precise formulas that characterize these ranks in terms of the exponents of the monomial. Let $M = x_0^{a_0} x_1^{a_1} \cdots x_n^{a_n}$ be a monomial of degree $d = \sum_{i=0}^{n} a_i$. We can assume, without loss of generality, that the exponents are ordered as $a_0 \leq a_1 \leq \dots \leq a_n$. \subsection{Waring Rank of Monomials} A significant result concerning the Waring rank of a monomial is: \begin{theorem}[\cite{CarliniCatalisanoGeramita2012,BuczynskaBuczynskiTeitler2014}]\label{thm:tight-bound-upper-bound-monomial-wr} The Waring rank of a monomial $x_0^{a_0} x_1^{a_1} \cdots x_n^{a_n}$ is given by \[ \WR(x_0^{a_0} x_1^{a_1} \cdots x_n^{a_n}) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} (a_i + 1) \] assuming $a_0 \leq a_1 \leq \dots \leq a_n$. \end{theorem} \begin{lemma}[Orthogonality of roots of unity]\label{lem:orthogonality} Let \( r \in \mathbb{N} \), and \(\zeta \in \mathbb{C}\) be a primitive \(r\)-th root of unity, i.e., \(\zeta^r = 1\) and \(\zeta^k \neq 1\) for \(1 \le k < r\). Then for any integers \(m, k\), \[ \sum_{j=0}^{r-1} \zeta^{j(m-k)} = \begin{cases} r & \text{if } m \equiv k \pmod{r}, \\ 0 & \text{otherwise}. \end{cases} \] \end{lemma} \begin{proof} Set \(\omega \eqdef \zeta^{m-k}\). Then \[ S \eqdef\sum_{j=0}^{r-1} \zeta^{j(m-k)} = \sum_{j=0}^{r-1} \omega^j. \] If \(m \equiv k \pmod{r}\), then \(\omega = 1\) and \[ S=\sum_{j=0}^{r-1} 1=r. \] Otherwise, \(\omega \neq 1\) and since \(\omega^r = (\zeta^r)^{m-k} = 1\), \[ S=\frac{1 - \omega^r}{1 - \omega} = \frac{1 - 1}{1 - \omega} = 0. \] \end{proof} Now we prove \cref{thm:tight-bound-upper-bound-monomial-wr}. \printbibliography \end{document}]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[%layout: post %title: Transformation %date: 2025-08-23 11:12:00-0400 %description: Arithmetic circuits for Root transformed polynomials %tags: transforming roots %categories: ACT %related_posts: false % \documentclass[a4paper,11pt,american]{article} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% % === Geometry and Fonts=== %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% \usepackage{geometry} \geometry{verbose,tmargin=1in,bmargin=1in,lmargin=1in,rmargin=1in} \usepackage{mathptmx} % Times font \usepackage{comment} % Times font]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Transformation of Roots</title><link href="https://goravjindal.github.io/blog/2025/08/transform-roots-act/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Transformation of Roots"/><published>2025-08-22T15:12:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-08-22T15:12:00+00:00</updated><id>https://goravjindal.github.io/blog/2025/08/transform-roots-act</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://goravjindal.github.io/blog/2025/08/transform-roots-act/"><![CDATA[<blockquote class="theorem"> <h4 id="theorem-cholesky">Theorem 1 (Cholesky Factorization)</h4> <p>Let $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$.
